# Isomorfeus

## Release goals:

+ Backend independent
+ Webpack based build and hot-reloading process (no Sprockets)
+ Faster and simplified Isomorphic Models
  + Redis or others for pub/sub
  + ORM agnostic (tested with ActiveRecord SQL and Neo4j.rb)
+ Updated Operation DSL (business logic and bidirectional client/server execution)
+ IsomorfeusPolicy for authorisation and authentication on the client and server
+ Faster rspec framework plus automated build and deploy process
